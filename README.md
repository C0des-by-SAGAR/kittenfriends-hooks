# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Kitten Friends is a simple React application that allows users to search for cute kitten images.

This project serves as a fun way to practice React concepts like state management, component lifecycle, and API integration.

**Features:**
- Search for kitten images by name.
- Dynamic display of kitten images based on search query.
- Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices.
- Fetches data from the [Kitten API](https://thecatapi.com/).
